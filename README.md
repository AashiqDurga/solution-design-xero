# Solution Design 

## How to consume this repo ðŸ“–
Thank you for taking the time to got through this solution design, below are a few guidelines:
* I have grouped sections into folders that have README files going in to a bit more detail about the section.
* There are links to sections as you read that will take you to files or directories. I suggest reading through this entire page first before clicking through so you don't loose context. 
* Everything has been done in markdown so GitHub may be the best place to view this. Alternatively you can clone this repo and explore in your favourite editor.


## Context :small_airplane:
Airports have many flights departing on a daily basis. They are required to keep a schedule of the regular flights and all related information. Any changes made to the flights are amended on these schedules and are reflected appropriately. 

The flight schedule information needs to be centrally stored and accessible to travelers at the airport via a display board and an online interface.

Travelers can subscribe to notification about specific flight information changes.

Airlines will be able to independently update the information about the schedule as and when required via an interface only accesable by them.

# System Components

* [Web API for display board and Mobile devices](web-api/README.md)
* [Application for airline staff](airline-application/README.md)
* [Push notification services](push-notification-service/README.md)
* [AWS Infrastructure](aws-infrastructure/README.md)
* [CICD]()

# Assumptions and Trade offs ðŸ¤”
* Alerts and monitoring is out of scope for this design.
* Details of the mobile application for users is out of scope.
* Existing flight infomation needs to be imported but that ETL process is out of scope.
* Message board is polling the web-api for data. 
* The provided *example*  code for the web api is not perfect and serves purely as an indication of how the tools and technology could be used
